<h1><b><u>Face Detection with VGG-Face Model</u></b></h1>
This project demonstrates face detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-Face model. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab and leverages pre-trained weights to facilitate efficient and accurate face recognition.

<h1><b><u>Overview</u></b></h1>
This project involves the following steps:

Downloading and Extracting a Dataset for Face Recognition: Obtain a suitable dataset containing face images for training and evaluation.
Setting Up a CNN Architecture Inspired by VGG-Face:
Use Keras to create a CNN architecture inspired by the VGG-Face model.
Customize the architecture as needed for your specific use case.
Loading Pre-trained Weights:
Initialize the model with pre-trained weights from the VGG-Face model.
These pre-trained weights provide robust feature extraction capabilities.
Fine-tuning on a Custom Dataset (Optional):
If you have a custom dataset, fine-tune the model to adapt it to your specific face recognition task.
Evaluating Model Performance on Face Detection Tasks:
Use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the model’s accuracy and efficiency in detecting faces.
