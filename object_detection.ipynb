<h1><b>Face Detection with VGG-Face Model</b></h1>
    <p>This project demonstrates face detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-Face model. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab and leverages pre-trained weights to facilitate efficient and accurate face recognition.</p>

    <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Downloading and extracting a dataset for face recognition.</li>
        <li>Setting up a CNN architecture inspired by the VGG-Face model using Keras.</li>
        <li>Loading pre-trained weights to initialize the model.</li>
        <li>Potentially fine-tuning the model on a custom dataset.</li>
        <li>Evaluating the model's performance on face detection tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-trained Model:</strong> Utilizes the VGG-Face model with pre-trained weights for robust feature extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Includes steps to load, preprocess, and augment image data for training and evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable Architecture:</strong> The model architecture can be modified for specific use cases or further fine-tuning.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Evaluation:</strong> Tools and methods for evaluating the modelâ€™s performance on various metrics.</li>
    </ul>
