<h1><b>Face Detection with VGG-Face Model</b></h1>
This project demonstrates face detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG-Face model. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab and leverages pre-trained weights to facilitate efficient and accurate face recognition.

Overview
This project involves:

Downloading and extracting a dataset for face recognition.
Setting up a CNN architecture inspired by the VGG-Face model using Keras.
Loading pre-trained weights to initialize the model.
Potentially fine-tuning the model on a custom dataset.
Evaluating the model's performance on face detection tasks.
Features
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes the VGG-Face model with pre-trained weights for robust feature extraction.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps to load, preprocess, and augment image data for training and evaluation.
Customizable Architecture: The model architecture can be modified for specific use cases or further fine-tuning.
Performance Evaluation: Tools and methods for evaluating the modelâ€™s performance on various metrics.
